The program simdff is for identifying similar or different temporal gene expression profiles.
The expression value should be log2 transformed using command log2(value+0.01). And it is possible, it is
best to transform the value use the following perl command:

if(value>0.01){ log2_transformed_value = log2(value)}
else {log2_transformed_value = log2(rand()*0.01)}

1) compile the program
cd code
make

2) Preparing input file
The input file is a gene times expression value matrix. The rows are genes and the columns are the
expression value for different time points. There is no header given in the input file, and only expression
values showing in the file. The values are seperated by space.

3) Preparing _mu and _Sigma files
There is a R scrpit included in the package named analysis.R. The script is used for generating
_mu (mean expression for each time points across genes), and _Sigma (variance and covariance matrix
for the expression matrix). You need specified the input file name and output file name. The two ouput
files generated will be name output_mu.txt and output_Sigma.txt. To run the script:

Rscript analysis.R --args input.txt output

4) Run the program
The command for running the program using the specified input file and the _mu and _Sigma files is

./simdiff input.txt output_mu.txt output_Sigma.txt -startg 0 -endg 1000

Note that you need to specify the start gene index and the end gene index using arguments -startg and
-endg. In the above example, it calculates the BF for the first 1000 genes (index 0 to 999).

5) Program output
The output will be printed to screen, unless the screen output is printed to a file, e.g., using "> results".
The output include three columns: the first gene index, the second gene index, and the BF of their similarity.
Note that larger BF means they are similar and smaller BF suggests they are different.
